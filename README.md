# Satellite Trajectory Interactive Application

## Overview
This repository contains an interactive application for satellite trajectory visualization and analysis. The main project files can be found in the **Interactive Application** folder.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To get started with the project, ensure you have the following tools installed:
- **[Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)**: A minimal Conda installer for creating and managing isolated environments. Miniconda was used to ensure that all dependencies are managed within a dedicated environment, avoiding conflicts with system Python or other projects. This approach provides greater control over package versions and compatibility.

The following Python libraries are required for this project:
- **Numpy**: For numerical computations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating visualizations and plots.
- **Astropy**: For astronomical calculations and transformations.
- **Skyfield**: For satellite trajectory and positional calculations.
- **Tkinter**: For building the graphical user interface (GUI) of the application.
- **And more**
